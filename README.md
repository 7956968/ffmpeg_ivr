# ffmpeg_ivr
ffmpeg_ivr is an extension of FFmpeg library, it provides a library which register a new cloud-oriented media fragment muxer into the ffmpeg avformat framework, and a new application, called ffmpeg_ivr, which make use of the new library. The new muxer is usually used as a video recorder, which is able to upload the media fragments(TS format) to cloud-storage system like Aliyun OSS through HTTP, as well as save the fragments to the local filesystem like XFSã€‚On the other hand, it also send the infomation of each fragment to the specified http server, which can gather these meta-info the generate the corresponding m3u8 list for these fragments.  

> "ivr" suffix comes from our project name, means Internet Video Recorder

## Features 

* Supports media fragments for M3U8 playback format (M3U8 is the most popular video format for internet nowadays).
* Supports almost all video/audio codec.
* Provides a fragment queue to overcome the IO jitter, which can work in block or non-block mode
* A standalone IO thread to handle fragment writing, so that there is no disturbance to the main muxing thread.
* Support various writer type, which includes dummy writer, file writer, and ivr writer by default, and you can register your own one.
* IVR writer can upload the fragments by HTTP, as well as save the fragments to the local file system. 
* Metadata of each fragments is post to the specifiled URL through http in IVR writer. 
* Support pre-allocation and fragment aggregation for local filesystem in IVR writer.

## Dependencies

To install it, you'll need to satisfy the following dependencies:


* [FFmpeg](https://janus.conf.meetecho.com/) (2.8.x version must used, API of later version is not compatible)
* [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/)

## Compilation

After install the dependencies successfully, configure and compile as usual to start the whole compilation process:

	./configure 
	make
	make install

After the above, a library, called libffmpeg_ivr, and a application, named ffmpeg_ivr would be installed into your system at the default path(usually at /usr/local). If you want to change the default path, you can use the following command to re-configure 

	./configure --prefix=/your new path/
  
## Usage
  
After installation, you can use "ffmpeg_ivr" command like the original ffmpeg, but support the new mux format, named "cseg". like:
  
	ffmpeg_ivr -i your_live_video_url -f cseg dummy://dummy
 
which is writing the fragments to a dummy writer(just print the metadata of each segment)

	ffmpeg_ivr -i your_live_video_url -f cseg file://test_media
  
which is writing the fragments to the local file with prefix test_media at the root path.

	ffmpeg_ivr -i your_live_video_url [other_ffmpeg_options] -f cseg [cseg_options] ivr://ivr_service_url
  
which posts the meta info of each fragment to the ivr_service_url and get back the storage url for the corresponding fragment, then upload/save the fragment to this url.
